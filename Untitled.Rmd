This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(threejs)
library(igraph)
library(shiny)


set.seed(1)
g <- sample_islands(3, 10, 5/10, 1)
i <- cluster_optimal(g)
g <- set_vertex_attr(g, "color", value=c("yellow", "green", "blue")[i$membership])
print(graphjs(g))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
