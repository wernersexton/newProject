## Main Points

There were several main focuses we can incorporate

- Reproducible Research

- Data Empathy

- Better tooling

## Reproducible Research

This was a big focus with companies like Airbnb and Jet Blue talking about how they keep their analysis reporducibile. 

It can be a serious financial risk to companies to lose research and analysis due to staffing or tooling changes. 

Airbnb maintains a comprehensive, searchable "knowledge repository" that has 4 key features: 

- It is open to all employees
- Anything submitted to the repository in code is checked by atleast 2 other people
- They use Github to manage the submissions
- They opensourced the system so anyone can use it

They prioritize contributions as: 

<center> Documentation > Usability > Performance > Features </center>

## It's less complicated in the end

## Data Empathy

Several speakers touched on how important it is to maintain perspective when creating analysis.

- "The Near" and "The Far" - illustrated by tracing one person's lifecycle first and then expanding that to millions. 

Important to keep this in mind as we do analysis
